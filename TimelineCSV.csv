Psychology,1843,John Stuart Mill,"Psychology first became a science separate from philosophy, based on experiment and observation.",
Introspection,1879,Wilhelm Wundt,"First psychology laboratory and institute established in Leipzig, Germany. Studied reaction time with experiments based on how long it takes someone to react. Introspection was established as theory surrounding the systematic examination of mental experiences, and required people to report on the content of their thoughts. Introspection was used to get people to report on the content of their thoughts.",
Structuralism,1910,Edward Titchner,"Titchner was a student of Wundt, and theorized that conscious experiences can be broken down into their underlying basic components. This established a scientific basis for understanding the mind, and remained foundational even after it was rejected. Titchner used introspection to ask people to break sounds down into their constituent thoughts, Wundt rejected this practice.",
Functionalism,1873,William James,"James started teaching at Harvard in 1873, and was one of the few professors at the time to welcome questions from students, and openly supported female pioneers (such as Mary Whiton Calkins). Functionalism is concerned with the adaptive purpose and function of the mind and behavior. In 1890, he published an influential book called ""Principles of Psychology.""",Structuralism
Stream of Conciousness,1873,Wiliam James,"James coined this term to describe the fact that each person experiences a continuous series of ever-changing thoughts, and that the mind is very complex and ever changing.",
Evolutionary Theory,1859,Charles Darwin,"Upon publishing his theories about the history of species based on the inherited, adaptive value of characteristics and behaviors, Darwin's theories supported those of functionalist psychologists. The famous book ""On the Origin of Species'' was published in 1859.",
Psychoanalysis,1897,"Sir Francis Galton, Sigmund Freud","Contrary to popular belief, the theory of the unconscious, where mental processes operate below the level of conscious awareness, was first proposed by Galton, not Freud. Freud was one of the most famous psychologists, beginning his career working with paralyzed patients under his medical training. Freud is most famous for psychoanalysis, the method of attempting to bring the unconscious thoughts of an individual into the conscious awareness so that conflicts can be revealed. These conflicts were thought to be sexual in nature, often involving repressed childhood memories, and could be analyzed from dreams and free association. Not all of psychoanalysis is still respected, but the existence of the unconscious is still widely accepted and understood.",
Behaviorism,1913,"John B. Watson, B. F. Skinner","Watson scorned the study of mental processes because they aren’t measurable. Thus, behaviorism was born. Behaviorism is the approach that emphasizes the role of environmental factors in influencing behaviors. This theory emphasized that all behavior is learned through environmental stimuli and response. In 1971, Skinner published a book about Behaviorism known as “Beyond Freedom and Dignity.” Few modern psychologists are strict behaviorists, but the theory dominated into the early 1960’s.",
Gestalt Theory,1912,"Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler","Wertheimer began developing the Gestalt theory in 1912, and Köler later expanded the theory. The basics of Gestalt theory outline that the whole of an experience is different from the sum of its parts. This theory holds that everything is subjective, and that people impose their prior experiences on new environments and experiences.",Structuralism
Humanistic Psychology,1950,"Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, Martin Seligman","Humanistic psychology focuses on the basic goodness of people, and how accepting themselves and working towards their personal goals can help them to become more fulfilled. This theory is also known as positive psychology, and is still present today.",
Cognitive Neuroscience,1957,"George A. Miller, Ulric Neisser","Cognitive neuroscience is the study of brain mechanisms underlying thought, learning, perception, language, and memory. This theory emphasizes the integration of the “software” and “hardware” of the mind and brain. It stemmed from Miller, who started as a behaviorist, but began the cognitive revolution in 1957 when he changed his mind, and came to understand that mental functions are important for understanding behavior. In 1967, Neisser published his book on cognitive psychology, and in the 1980s the integrated view of the mind and the brain was widely accepted.",
